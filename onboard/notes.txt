For ADC:
ADC device is MPC3008. It uses SPI interface to communicate with
the rapsberry pi. I followed the following two websites to set up
the ADC with the hardware (not bit-banged) SPI on the pi:

For setting up the wired connections to the ADC:

For installing python spidev package and the basic python script:
https://www.modmypi.com/8-channel-10-bit-analog-to-digital-converter

There are a few things you need to do to configure the pi to use
hardware SPI which are mentioned on the above two websites. These
things are preventing the pi from blacklisting spi, and also just
installing python spi libraries.

The adc.py is the script from the second website which simply reads
all of the ADC channels. In the sensor_functions.py I added a 
readvoltage function which reads only the adc value from channel 0.
This basically assumes that the voltage sensor is attached to 
channel 0 and that the reference voltage is set to 3.3 V. If you
set the ref voltage to 5 V you just need to change the multiplicative
factor in the equation to calculate the actual voltage value from the
adc value read. The value of 5 comes from the fact that the sensor
divides the actual voltage by 5 so that is below the ref voltage.

If you want to add analog devices to be read from the adc, just create
a similar function to the readvoltage function and do the appropriate
conversion of adc value to actual value.
